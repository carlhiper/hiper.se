		Your privacy is critical to us. At HIPER (HIPER AB) we apply the following principles:<br>
		<br>
		Personal information is only asked after if it’s really important.
		We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to; follow applicable laws, 
		develop HIPER, or make sure our agreements are followed.
		We only store personal information necessary to the on-going operations of HIPER.<br>
		<br>
		Website Visitors<br>
		Like most other website operators, HIPER (HIPER AB) collects non-identifying 
		information (browser type, language preference, referring site, and date and time of 
		each visitor request). HIPER (HIPER AB) may occasionally release non-identifying 
		information in a collected form, e.g., by publishing reports based on the usage of HIPER 
		services.<br>
		<br>
		HIPER (HIPER AB) also collects potentially personally-identifying information like 
		Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. HIPER (HIPER AB) only discloses 
		logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses 
		and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.<br>
		<br>
		Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<br>
		Certain visitors to HIPER (HIPER AB)’s websites choose to interact with HIPER (HIPER 
		AB) in ways that require HIPER (HIPER AB) to gather personally-identifying 
		information. The amount and type of information that HIPER (HIPER AB) gathers 
		depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for 
		an account at HIPER.se to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in 
		transactions with HIPER (HIPER AB) – by purchasing access to the services, for example<br> 
		– are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and 
		financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, HIPER (HIPER 
		AB) collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the 
		purpose of the visitor’s interaction with HIPER (HIPER AB). HIPER (HIPER AB) does not 
		disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors 
		can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it 
		may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.<br>
		<br>
		Aggregated Statistics<br>
		HIPER (HIPER AB) may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. 
		HIPER (HIPER AB) may display this information publicly or provide it to others. 
		However, HIPER (HIPER AB) does not disclose personally-identifying information other 
		than as described below.<br>	
		<br>
		Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information<br>
		HIPER (HIPER AB) discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-
		identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated 
		organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on HIPER 
		(HIPER AB)’s behalf or to provide services available at HIPER (HIPER AB)’s websites and 
		applications/products, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of 
		those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your 
		home country; by using HIPER (HIPER AB)’s websites, you consent to the transfer of 
		such information to them. HIPER (HIPER AB) will not rent or sell potentially personally-
		identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its 
		employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, HIPER (HIPER 
		AB) discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information 
		only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when 
		HIPER (HIPER AB) believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to 
		protect the property or rights of HIPER (HIPER AB), third parties or the public at large. If 
		you are a registered user of an HIPER (HIPER AB) website and/or service and have 
		supplied your email address, HIPER (HIPER AB) may occasionally send you an email to 
		tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with 
		what’s going on with HIPER (HIPER AB) and our products. If you send us a request (for 
		example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the 
		right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us 
		support other users. HIPER (HIPER AB) takes all measures reasonably necessary to 
		protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially 
		personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.<br>
		<br>
		Cookies<br>
		A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that 
		the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. HIPER 
		(HIPER AB) uses cookies to help HIPER (HIPER AB) identify and track visitors, their 
		usage of HIPER (HIPER AB) website, and their website access preferences. HIPER 
		(HIPER AB) visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should 
		set their browsers to refuse cookies before using HIPER (HIPER AB)’s websites, with the 
		drawback that certain features of HIPER (HIPER AB)’s websites may not function 
		properly without the aid of cookies.<br>
		<br>
		Business Transfers<br>
		If HIPER (HIPER AB), or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely 
		event that HIPER (HIPER AB) goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user 
		information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. 
		You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of HIPER (HIPER 
		AB) may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.<br>
		<br>
		Ads<br>
		Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, 
		who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer 
		each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or 
		others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other 
		things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. 
		This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by HIPER (HIPER AB) and does not cover 
		the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
		<br>
		Privacy Policy Changes<br>
		Although most changes are likely to be minor, HIPER (HIPER AB) may change its Privacy 
		Policy from time to time, and in HIPER (HIPER AB)’s sole discretion. HIPER (HIPER AB) 
		encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If 
		you have a HIPER account, we will contact via email you if we make changes to the 
		policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will 
		constitute your acceptance of such change.
